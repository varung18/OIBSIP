The main objective of this project is to provide a complete automated Library by digitizing its each and every functionality. Starting from the book, keeping and issuing of books and query generation are done within this essential project. It is a desktop application, powered by a web server. In this Java Case, Xampp server is used, which is responsible for maintaining every single detail of the library. It has very user friendly interface which can be operated by any non-technical person.
